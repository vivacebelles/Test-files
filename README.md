  Getting used to having everything set up in my new lab! So, I'm learning the ropes around Git, as well as picking up Python,
  and making sure I'm familiar with the Vi/Vim editor. Here's to some good luck for me throughout the new year for this project!

Updates: all python files now work on some basic commands! Yes! :) \o/

Finished through the basic beginner's "Learning Python" via Lynda.com, and it's been great! Now I have a better working understanding of working with the code. I just need to get used to doing shell work and getting them to committed amongst all the places I have available for work.

Need to look at OSpathutils.py again though!

Starting Py3 Essential Training, so I will be reviewing and strengthening my skills in Python (and specifically with the most current version of Python).

So I'll probably build off of the same py code files I've been utilizing but may add new files.
