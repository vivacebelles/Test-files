# Test-files
While I'm practicing coding and the like, I'm using this repository to test out all the changes I've made!

  Getting used to having everything set up in my new lab! So, I'm learning the ropes around Git, as well as picking up Python,
  and making sure I'm familiar with the Vi/Vim editor. Here's to some good luck for me throughout the new year for this project!

Updates: all python files now work on some basic commands! Yes! :) \o/

Finished through the basic beginner's "Learning Python" via Lynda.com, and it's been great! Now I have a better working understanding of working with the code. I just need to get used to doing shell work and getting them to committed amongst all the places I have available for work.

Need to look at OSpathutils.py again though!

Starting Py3 Essential Training, so I will be reviewing and strengthening my skills in Python (and specifically with the most current version of Python).

So I'll probably build off of the same py code files I've been utilizing but may add new files.

Added more files through the Python Training. Weirdly enough, Py3 is not doing accepting the def main() in the coding that I've been doing, and I haven't exactly figured out why. But, I'm learning about objects and classes more thoroughly now. So, progress is great!

It's been a while! So, I've done some more essential training with Python on Lynda with the new Python 3 module. Funnily enough, there is a distint difference since the print is a function now that some of the old code doesn't work from python 2 to 3. Will be updating!

Interesting. Looks like Python3 doesn't have the libraries that Python 2 has to do test runs (like the earthquake runs). Well, now I know, and the code is cleaner and Python3 compliant though.
